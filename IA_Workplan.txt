		- Allow for precise geometric definition
			- Reduce imprecision and uncertainty
		- Extending Object Generation to sufficiently large spaces
		- Modelling discrete objects 
	- Mesh Generation for FEA
	- Results Generation and Analysis?

Intended Learning Outcomes:
	- Workflow in research environments
	- Technical Report Handling and Writing
	- Literature Review Process, verification and replication
